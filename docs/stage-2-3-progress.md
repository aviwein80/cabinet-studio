# Stage 2-3 progress

Read this first at the start of every run. Sources:

- Features and acceptance (source of truth): `docs/stage-2-3-spec.md`.
- How to work: `docs/stage-2-3-prompt.md`.
- Audit and 3D design: `docs/stage-2-3-audit.md`.

## Status

| Milestone | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| M2.0 Audit | **Done** | `docs/stage-2-3-audit.md`. |
| M2.1 3D foundation | **Done** (October 2026) | Includes the approved additions: machine-model data, `StockModel` and the bull-nose cutter, and the WASM/CSP groundwork. |
| M2.2a CL-surface engine, parallel finishing, boundaries, independent gouge checker | **Next** | |
| M2.2b Z-level roughing, waterline | Not started | Flat-layer output as `<105>` contours (decision 2). |
| M2.2c Projection finishing, performance | Not started | |
| M2.3 - M2.11 | Not started | Order as in the prompt. ART-01 stays at M2.11. |
| M3.1 - M3.7 | Not started | |

Test count: 218 at the start of Stage 2 (217 passed + 1 skipped), 263 after M2.1 (262 + 1 skipped).
Lint baseline: 17 warnings, all pre-existing (unchanged).

## Decisions received from the owner (October 2026)

1. Work on `main`. The audit branch was merged, and runs push straight to `main`.
2. 3D output to woodWOP starts with the flat-layer operations (Z-level roughing, waterline) as
   normal contour-milling macros. True 3D output stays off until the owner supplies a sample
   program saved from woodWOP on the shop PC.
3. N-200 facts will come later. Use clearly marked placeholders. Treat the saw unit as absent
   until it is confirmed.
4. Placeholder 3D tools are fine: clearly marked, and the banner stays.
5. Placeholder cutting values are fine for now.
6. Store 3D models as separate compressed files next to the shop file.
7. Fix the stale flag. One-time "stale" marks are acceptable.
8. Regenerate the sample job and pin the PDF date.
9. The new milestone order and the M2.2 split are approved.
10. Report cloud speed numbers, and give the one-line command for timing on the owner's Mac.
11. DWG stays out. DXF only; DWG files go through the free ODA File Converter first.

## Open questions for the owner

1. **N-200 figures** (machine model): travel limits, table size, origin, spoilboard thickness,
   tool-change position, and whether a saw unit and an aggregate are fitted. Placeholders until
   then.
2. **Real 3D tools and holders**: ball-nose, bull-nose and tapered tools; shank diameters; flute
   lengths; stick-outs; holder outlines.
3. **3D feeds, speeds, step-downs and step-overs** for the shop's materials.
4. **A small 3D program saved from woodWOP**, needed for true 3D output (decision 2).
5. **Rhino (.3dm) and SketchUp (.skp) import**: there is no permissive reader for these, so they
   are not built (spec CAD-13). Options:
   - export STL/OBJ from those programs (works today);
   - openNURBS for Rhino (permissive licence, a native/WASM build would be needed);
   - skip.

   Recommendation: export STL/OBJ.

## M2.1 3D foundation: what was built

| Spec ID | What | Where |
|---|---|---|
| CAD-13 | STL (binary/ASCII), OBJ and 3MF readers; unit choice; up axis (auto = lay flat); repair report; bad-file errors | `src/cam/mesh/read.ts`, `build.ts`, `place.ts` |
| NEW-18 | Simplify (percent or measured tolerance), Z sections to closed contours, section series, outline projected to XY, feature edges to 3D polylines, delete facets, STL export | `src/cam/mesh/tools.ts`, `simplify.ts`, `distance.ts` |
| SOL-05 | Work volume fitted to a model with oversize around/above/below; outline resized | `fitWorkVolumeToModel` in `src/cam/mesh/place.ts` |
| TOOL-04 (fields) | `shankDiameter`, `fluteLength`, `gaugeLength`, `holderId`; machine `holders` (placeholder collet chuck); `cutterOutline` | `src/core/types.ts`, `src/core/machineModel.ts`, Machine page tool dialog |
| 3D-12 | Compute worker pool with progress and cancel; heavy 3D tasks run off the UI thread | `src/cam/worker/` |
| NEW-13 (data) | `MachineModel` on `MachineProfile.physical`; placeholder N-200; export checker `MACHINE_PLACEHOLDER`, `MACHINE_CANNOT` (saw), `OFF_TABLE` | `src/core/machineModel.ts`, `validator.ts`, Machine page |
| Stock | `StockModel` interface + `HeightfieldStock` (shares the simulator's carving); bull-nose cutter; watertight stock mesh | `src/cam/stock/` |
| Format | `CAM_FILE_VERSION` 2 with step migrations; models as SHA-256 blobs outside the shop file (desktop `data/blobs`, browser IndexedDB); part files embed their blobs; 30-day clean-up of unused blobs | `src/cam/doc.ts`, `src/cam/model/`, `electron/blobGc.ts` |

Housekeeping done in this milestone:

- **Stale flag**: now also reacts to the through depth and to the material feed row.
- **PDFs**: pinned to the job date in UTC, so they are byte-identical between runs.
- **Sample job**: regenerated.
- **Feature switches**: the 4 switches that were never read are now wired and shown.
- **Tool selection**: 2D operations never pick a ball-nose or bull-nose tool automatically.
- **CSP**: allows WebAssembly.
- **New switch**: "3D models" (`cam3d`, default on).

### Acceptance

| Criterion | Proof | Measured |
|---|---|---|
| Binary + ASCII STL and OBJ (and 3MF) with units and orientation | `tests/cam-mesh.test.ts` (import, units, up axis, 3MF transforms) | - |
| 1 M triangles in < 5 s | `tests/perf.test.ts` | 1.45-1.8 s alone, 2.4 s with the full suite (cloud container) |
| 10 MB ASCII STL imports | `tests/cam-mesh.test.ts` | ~10.4 MB, well under the 10 s limit |
| Corrupt files give a clean error | `tests/cam-mesh.test.ts` "bad files" | Each case raises `MeshReadError` with a plain message |
| Simplify within a measured Hausdorff tolerance | `tests/cam-mesh.test.ts` | 10 %: 0.066 mm on the sine relief (checked against the analytic surface); tolerance mode holds 0.02 and 0.05 mm |
| Z sections return closed contours | `tests/cam-mesh.test.ts` | Sphere, torus (outer + hole), plane through a vertex ring |
| Work volume fits the model with oversize | `tests/cam-mesh.test.ts`, `tests/cam-3d-foundation.test.ts` | - |
| Heavy work in workers, cancellable, with progress | `tests/cam-worker.test.ts` | Checked in the browser preview, the production build and Electron (Linux) |
| Tool gets shank, flute length, gauge length, holder | `tests/cam-machine-stock.test.ts` | - |
| Format bump; every Stage 1 golden loads unchanged | `tests/cam-model-store.test.ts` | All 20 parts are field-identical with byte-identical digests and MPRs; golden files untouched |
| Integration: import -> toolpath -> stock -> export checker | `tests/cam-3d-foundation.test.ts` | Blocked while MPR output is off; clean when it is on |

Time it on the shop Mac (in the repo folder, after `npm install`):

```bash
npx vitest run tests/perf.test.ts
```

### Deferred or limited (recorded, not hidden)

- **`app://` protocol and unpacked `.wasm` files** for Electron are deferred to M2.5. meshoptimizer
  embeds its WebAssembly, so `file://` loading works today (checked in Electron on Linux).
  Windows and macOS builds have not been run here.
- **The batch runner does not read model files yet.** No batch step uses 3D models until M2.2.
- **Holder outlines can't be edited in the UI yet.** Tools can only pick a holder; full holder
  editing is TOOL-04 in M2.7.
- **Simplify drops OBJ/3MF groups** from the simplified copy. The original is kept and can be
  restored.
- **Delete facets** in the UI removes downward-facing facets only. The core also deletes by group
  or below a Z; picking facets by hand comes with 3D picking (M2.5).
- **The simulator screen still uses the heightfield directly.** It moves onto the `StockModel`
  interface in M2.4.

## Next run: M2.2a

Work from the audit sections 5.3-5.4:

- Add the `finish3d` op kind with a parallel strategy, the shared `Surface3D` block and the
  compact `{ t: 'poly' }` move.
- Build the exact drop-cutter for flat, ball, bull-nose and V cutters.
- Add the boundary and protected-surface options (3D-11).
- Write the independent gouge checker.
- Make golden digests under `tests/golden/cam3d/`.
- Feed the model blob hash and placement into `opInputHash`.
- Let the batch runner read model blobs.

## Run log

- **Run 1 (M2.0)**: audit and this file. Pushed `9492d66`; merged to `main` in run 2.
- **Run 2 (M2.1)**: commits `00b8c71`, `23ead2d`, `a96c23d`, `5998e05`, `40c481f`, `e3e9095`,
  and the docs commit at the end of the run.
